# Analytics Fix Documentation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Admin Panel Organization Analytics Not Fetching

**Problem**: Organization analytics graphs were not displaying data when clicking on "Analytics" for an organization.

**Root Causes**:

- Hardcoded API URLs using `localhost:5000` instead of environment variables

- Missing error handling and fallbacks
- Backend route had undefined variable issues

**Fixes Applied**:

- ✅ Replaced hardcoded URLs with `${import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL}`
- ✅ Initialized `orgAnalytics` state with proper default structure
- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling with fallback data
- ✅ Fixed backend analytics route to properly handle missing data
- ✅ Added debugging logs for troubleshooting

### 2. Teacher Analytics Not Showing

**Problem**: Teacher analytics were not displaying when clicking on "Analytics" tab.

**Root Causes**:

- Users didn't understand they need to select a test first
- Unclear messaging about the selection requirement

**Fixes Applied**:

- ✅ Enhanced the "no test selected" message with clear instructions
- ✅ Added visual icon and step-by-step guidance
- ✅ Imported necessary Lucide React icons

### 3. Missing Analytics Charts in Admin Panel
